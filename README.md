This README file describes the data analysis and visualization for the Airbnb listings dataset in New York City.

Software, libraries, and tools
The following software, libraries, and tools are required to use this project:

Python
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Data cleaning
The following data cleaning steps were performed:

Dropped rows with missing values
Removed special symbols from the price column and converted it to a numeric type
Dropped duplicate rows
Used the Winsorize function to reduce the effect of outliers in the price column
Data analysis
The following data analysis steps were performed:

Created a histogram of the price column to understand the range, mode, median, mean, and variability of prices
Created a boxplot of the price column by neighborhood group to understand the distribution of prices by neighborhood group
Created a scatter plot of the price column and the number of reviews column to understand the relationship between price and number of reviews
Created a bar plot of the average price by room type
Created a heatmap of the correlation between different features in the dataset
Data visualization
The following data visualizations were created:

Histogram of the price column
Boxplot of the price column by neighborhood group
Scatter plot of the price column and the number of reviews column
Bar plot of the average price by room type
Heatmap of the correlation between different features in the dataset
Findings
The following findings were made from the data analysis and visualization:

The range of prices is large, with the lowest price being 0 and the highest price being 600.
The most common price is around 40.
The median price is around 100.
The average price is around 140, which is higher than the median because of the skewness and outliers.
The distribution of prices varies by neighborhood group, with Manhattan having the highest median price and Queens having the lowest median price.
There is a weak negative relationship between price and number of reviews, meaning that as the number of reviews increases, the price tends to decrease slightly. However, the relationship is not very strong.
The average price for a private room is the highest, followed by an entire home/apartment, a hotel room, and a shared room.
There is a strong positive correlation between price and number of bedrooms, and between price and number of bathrooms.
There is a negative correlation between price and number of reviews, and between price and minimum nights.
The top four neighborhoods by number of listings are all located in Manhattan.
Conclusion
The Airbnb listings dataset in New York City is a large and diverse dataset that can be used to learn a lot about the Airbnb rental market in the city. The data analysis and visualization performed in this project provides insights into the range, distribution, and correlations of different features in the dataset. These insights can be used by Airbnb hosts and guests to make more informed decisions.
